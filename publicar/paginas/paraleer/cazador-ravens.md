Western Sahara – Refugee camp – Child – Illness – Imagination

12-year-old Bachir lives in a refugee camp in the Western Sahara, which has
been occupied by Moroccan troops for many years already. Because of a lung
disease, Bachir is confined to his tent; the sounds and noises coming through
the thin walls are his only connection to the outside world. His illness is
like a prison that also inhibits his inner development. But when Jamida
enters into his life, the boy finally gains new hope. Thanks to the old man,
who is invisible to the boy, Bachir and the readers learn about the history
of his people and the distant world of the stars. Ricardo Gómez conveys the
coming-of-age of this boy with great empathy and sympathy for his
protagonist. (12+) (Premio Alandar; 2003)
